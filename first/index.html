		We all saw what happened to Ben Roethlisberger on Saturday, the sack from Bengals linebacker Vontaze Burfict that injured his throwing shoulder.
		<br><br>But what's happened since? What's Roethlisberger's day-to-day like right now, and what are the Steelers doing to get him ready to play Sunday in Denver, as he's expected to do?
		<br><br>First off, imagine waking up the next day. Your shoulder is throbbing. It's hard to even roll over, let alone push your way out of bed. You try to do the normal things you do on a daily basis, but everything is affected by the pain. The next day? Same thing.</p>
