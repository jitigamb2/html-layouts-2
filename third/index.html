			<h1>Sanctions lifted after Iran found in compliance on nuclear deal</h1>
			<p>(CNN)Iran has completed the necessary steps in a deal to restrict its nuclear program, meaning international economic sanctions are lifted, Iran and international inspectors said.</p>

			<p>The milestone was welcomed by the parties involved in the deal, with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry saying the world was a safer place as a result and Iran's President Hassan Rouhani hailing it as a "historic day" for the Islamic republic.</p>
			
			<p>"We've now closed off every single path Iran had to building a (nuclear) bomb," U.S. President Barack Obama said Sunday. "We'll know if Iran ever tries to break out."</p>
			
			<p>He added: "We've achieved this historic progress through diplomacy, without resorting to another war in the Middle East."</p>
			
			<p>Speaking at a press conference in Tehran on Sunday, Rouhani hailed the agreement as "a tool for the progress, growth and development of the country, as well as the security and stability of the region."</p>

			<p>He said that the agreement proved that "constructive engagement" with the world was the right path.</p>

				<p>"As of today, it has become clear that the win-win policy is the right one," he said. "We can interact with the world in favor of our nation, and of course not in a manner that disfavors others."</p>
				<p>Obama said that engaging with Iran had created a unique opportunity, and that the international community had reached a "milestone" in ensuring the Islamic republic did not develop a nuclear weapon.</p>
